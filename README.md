# Binary-Box

This is a learning project for Teachers and Students for a summer camp to be able to play with binary numbers with hardware switches and then see the numeric representation of that binary value in other counting systems. The user will also be given a kit so they can build the box themselves. This gives the user a easy-to-digest dive into electronics.

The ESP32S breakout board was selected because there is no hardware requirement for programming making this project very accessible to beginners without the need of other hardware investments. The ESP32 is a very capable MCU with A/D, CapSense, GPIO, Wifi, BlueTooth, SPI, I2C, etc. It is a great platform for learning and packs a lot of tech onboard with a really good pricepoint. Coupled with the Arduino IDE/Community, it is a really nice chip for getting things done. Also, interested students can use this MCU in other projects as they see fit after this project is complete.

A 3D Printer will be used to building the boxes to house the components and all the parts for this project can be purchased from amazon.
